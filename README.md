- Create a .gitignore file in the root of the repository

2.  `git commit -m "commit message"`
3.  `git push -u origin main`

## Delete all local git files

- `rm -rf .git`

## Clone a repository

- `git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME.git`
  OR
- `gh repo clone YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME`

## Pull remote changes from GitHub to local

- `git pull`

## Create a new branch

- `git branch BRANCH_NAME`
  Or, to create a new branch and switch to it immediately:
- `git checkout -b BRANCH_NAME`

## Switch to a branch

- `git checkout BRANCH_NAME`

## See all branches

- `git branch`

## Delete a branch

- `git branch -d BRANCH_NAME`
  OR
- `git branch --delete BRANCH_NAME`

## Merge a branch

- `git merge BRANCH_NAME`

## See all commits

- `git log`

## See all commits in a branch

- `git log BRANCH_NAME`

## HARD Reset to a commit (WARNING: this will delete all commits after the commit you are resetting to)

- `git reset --hard COMMIT_HASH`

## HARD Reset to a commit, delete all local changes (WARNING: this will delete all commits after the commit you are resetting to) and force push to remote (WARNING: this will delete all commits after the commit you are resetting to on the remote)

BEWARE: _Donâ€™t use this method if the github repo is being used by multiple users_

- `git reset --hard COMMIT_HASH`
- `git clean -f`
- `git push -f origin main`

## Show

File changes in directory:

- `git status`

  Changes in tracked files:

- `git diff`

  History;

- `git log`

  Who changed what and when:

- `git blame`

  Show commit:

- `git show COMMIT_HASH`

  Local branches

- `git branch`

## Revert

Undo to last commit

- `git reset --hard`

Undo a commit:

- `git reset --hard HEAD~1`

  Undo two commits:

- `git reset --hard HEAD~2`

Revert to specific commit:

- `git revert COMMIT_HASH`

## Resolve merge conflicts

View conflicts:

- `git diff`

View merge conflicts against base file:

- `git diff --base FILENAME`

View merge conflicts against your changes:

- `git diff --ours FILENAME`

View merge conflicts against their changes:

- `git diff --theirs FILENAME`

Discard a conflicting patch:

- `git reset --hard`
- `git rebase --skip`

After resolving conflicts, merge with:

- `git add FILENAME`
- `git rebase --continue`

## Display description and README.md of a repository

- `gh repo view`
- `gh repo view https://github.com/emanuelefavero/REPO-NAME.git`

## Get how many commits a day in a repo

- `git log --date=short --pretty=format:%ad | sort | uniq -c`

## Get how many commits a month in a repo

- `git log --date=short --pretty=format:%am | sort | uniq -c`

## Get how many commits a year in a repo

- `git log --date=short --pretty=format:%ay | sort | uniq -c`

- `upstream` is the name of the remote repository you forked from
- `origin` is the name of the remote repository you cloned from
- `local` is the name of the local repository

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone the repository
3. Add the original repository as a remote: `git remote add upstream UPSTREAM_URL`
4. Create a new branch for the new feature or fix: `git checkout -b BRANCH_NAME`
5. Make your changes, commit and push to your forked repository and branch
6. Pull the latest changes from the original repository: `git pull upstream/main`
7. Be suer to jump back to your branch: `git checkout BRANCH_NAME`
8. Merge main into your branch: `git merge main`
9. Resolve any conflicts
10. Make the pull request to the original repository `git push origin BRANCH_NAME`

## Create a new feature in a repository that you own

- Create a new branch: `git checkout -b feat/my-new-feature`

- Work on your feature:

  ```bash
  git add .
  git commit -m "feat: add my new feature"

  # Optional: push the branch to the remote repository
  git push -u origin feat/my-new-feature
  ```

- Switch back to the main branch and pull the latest changes:

  ```bash
  git checkout main
  git pull
  ```

- Merge your feature branch into the main branch:

  ```bash
  git merge feat/my-new-feature
  ```

- Push the changes to the remote repository:

  ```bash
  git push origin main
  ```

- Delete the feature branch if you no longer need it:

  ```bash
  git branch -d feat/my-new-feature

  # If you pushed the branch to the remote repository, delete it there too
  git push origin --delete feat/my-new-feature
  ```
